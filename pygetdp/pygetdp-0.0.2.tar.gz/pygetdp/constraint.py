class Constraint(GetDPObject):
    """ Creates a constraint object: specifying constraints on function spaces and formulations
        Types for Constraint:

        Assign: To assign a value (e.g., for boundary condition).

        Init: To give an initial value (e.g., initial value in a time domain analysis). If two values are provided (with Value [ expression, expression ]), the first value can be used using the InitSolution1 operation. This is mainly useful for the Newmark time-stepping scheme.

        AssignFromResolution: To assign a value to be computed by a pre-resolution.

        InitFromResolution:To give an initial value to be computed by a pre-resolution.

        Network: To describe the node connections of branches in a network.

        Link: To define links between degrees of freedom in the constrained region with degrees of freedom in a “reference” region, with some coefficient. For example, to link the degrees of freedom in the contrained region Left with the degrees of freedom in the reference region Right, located Pi units to the right of the region Left along the X-axis, with the coeficient -1, one could write:

            { Name periodic;
              Case {
                { Region Left; Type Link ; RegionRef Right;
                  Coefficient -1; Function Vector[X[]+Pi, Y[], Z[]] ;
                  < FunctionRef XYZ[]; >
                }
              }
            }

            In this example, Function defines the mapping that translates the geometrical elements in the region Left by Pi units along the X-axis, so that they correspond with the elements in the reference region Right. For this mapping to work, the meshes of Left and Right must be identical. (The optional FunctionRef function allows to transform the reference region, useful e.g. to avoid generating overlapping meshes for rotational links.)

        LinkCplx: To define complex-valued links between degrees of freedom. The syntax is the same as for constraints of type Link, but Coeficient can be complex.
