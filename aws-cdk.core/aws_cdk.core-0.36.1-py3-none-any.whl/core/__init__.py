    You can use intrinsic functions, such as ``Fn.conditionIf``,

    stack resources. These conditions are evaluated based on input parameters
    that you declare when you create or update a stack. After you define all your
    conditions, you can associate them with resources or resource properties in
    the Resources and Outputs sections of a template.

    You define all conditions in the Conditions section of a template except for
    ``Fn.conditionIf`` conditions. You can use the ``Fn.conditionIf`` condition
    in the metadata attribute, update policy attribute, and property values in
    the Resources section and Outputs sections of a template.

    You might use conditions when you want to reuse a template that can create
    resources in different contexts, such as a test environment versus a
    production environment. In your template, you can add an EnvironmentType
    input parameter, which accepts either prod or test as inputs. For the
    production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain
    capabilities; however, for the test environment, you want to use less
    capabilities to save costs. With conditions, you can define which resources
    are created and how they're configured for each environment type.

    You can use ``toString`` when you wish to embed a condition expression
    in a property value that accepts a ``string``. For example::

       new sqs.Queue(this, 'MyQueue', {

        By default, uses

        In order to make sure logical IDs are unique and stable, we hash the resource
        construct tree path (i.e. toplevel/secondlevel/.../myresource) and add it as
        a suffix to the path components joined without a separator (CloudFormation
        IDs only allow alphanumeric characters).

        The result will be:

        <path.join('')><md5(path.join('/')>
        "human"      "hash"

        If the "human" part of the ID exceeds 240 characters, we simply trim it so
        the total ID doesn't exceed CloudFormation's 255 character limit.

        We only take 8 characters from the md5 hash (0.000005 chance of collision).

        Special cases:

        - If the path only contains a single component (i.e. it's a top-level
          resource), we won't add the hash to it. The hash is not needed for
          disamiguation and also, it allows for a more straightforward migration an
          existing CloudFormation template to a CDK stack without logical ID changes
          (or renames).
        - For aesthetic reasons, if the last components of the path are the same
          (i.e. ``L1/L2/Pipeline/Pipeline``), they will be de-duplicated to make the
          resulting human portion of the ID more pleasing: ``L1L2Pipeline<HASH>``
          instead of ``L1L2PipelinePipeline<HASH>``
        - If a component is named "Default" it will be omitted from the path. This
          allows refactoring higher level abstractions around constructs without affecting
          the IDs of already deployed resources.
        - If a component is named "Resource" it will be omitted from the user-visible
          path, but included in the hash. This reduces visual noise in the human readable
          part of the identifier.
